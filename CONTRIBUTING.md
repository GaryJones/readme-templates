Feel free to make pull requests for this project. Each new template should be accompanied by an update to the README.md in this project that outlines what should be changed in the template to customise it.

Instead of whole readme template files, pull requests that outline a particular section in a typical readme are also welcome. If you've got a great way to write a Credits section for instance, please share!
